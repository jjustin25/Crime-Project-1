-Spouse 2: Jennings Barfield (m.Aug. 1970; d.March 21, 1971)               
-Velma Barfield was incarcerated for approximately six months in 1975 for writing bad checks. It was after her release that she then began working as a caretaker for the elderly.              
 /////              
NGRI PLEA:(See Source 3): `Defendant [Velma Barfield] entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity in addition to a general plea of not guilty. The district attorney was given written notice of defendant`s intention to rely upon this defence. Dr. Bob Rollins, a psychiatrist specializing in forensic psychiatry, examined defendant upon her referral to the Forensic Unit of Dorothea Dix State Hospital by the district court. Dr. Rollins testified that though defendant was uncooperative, he concluded that she was competent to stand trial and that she knew the difference between right and wrong. Nothing in his examination led Dr. Rollins to conclude that defendant suffered from any type of mental illness at the time she allegedly administered poison to Stewart Taylor.`               
 /////              
 (See Source 3): Dr. Anthony Sainz also stated in a deposition that `while there was no evidence of mental illness on the part of the defendant, she did have what he termed a passive-aggressive personality with her judgment being immaturely developed.`               
 /////              
 (See Source 3): Dr. A. Eugene Douglas, psychiatrist, `concurred` with the findings of Drs. Sainz and Rollins.              
 /////              
 (See Source 3): Velma Barfield continued to argue that she `presented sufficient evidence tending to show mental illness and to raise the issue of whether she knew the nature and quality of her act or knew that it was wrong. We[,] [the N.C. Supreme Court] find this argument unpersuasive.`           
 /////      
CONFESSION: (See Source 3): `Earlier, in the presentation of the state`s case-in-chief, the statement which the defendant had given to Officers Parnell and Lovette was introduced into evidence. In her statement, the defendant confessed: I had given poison to people before and they died. The label (on the bottle of poison) read, `May be fatal if swallowed.``      
 /////           
DRUG USE: (See Source 3): `On voir dire defendant testified that on the morning of the second interview she had taken a quantity of drugs: two Sinequans, two Elavils, two Tylenol III, two Tranxenes, and three Valium [...].`     
 /////     
 (See Source 4): `[...]Velma Barfield bought rat poison [arsenic] and placed it into the food or drink of her intended victim. Gradually, the arsenic accumulated in the person`s body until death occurred` (p.222).          
   /////       
 (See Source 4): In support of Velma Barfield, Richard Burr (of the Southern Prisoners` Defense Committee) spoke with Barfield with the possibility of him becoming her lawyer, in mind. In his conversation, he stated:  `Basically, the pre-trial evaluations concluded that she suffered from functional depressions and personality disorders. I felt that there had to be more because there was a long history of prescription drug abuse. Furthermore, as I became acquainted with Velma, I learned more about her childhood and the difficulties she suffered as a child. Tragically, she and the other children in her family were victims of violence and sexual abuse` (p.223). ---None of Burr`s conversations nor Barfield`s alleged past of abuse was entered into court records.",Death Row Granny,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,
