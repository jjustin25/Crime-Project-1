School Prob: inappropriate sketches in grade school. Poor grades in college and chronic petty thief. (2)           
                          
Method: Liked to pick out vics (usually by stalking or `trolling` them. Only random selection and deviation from his pattern was Vain-see vic profile).(2)                      
                    
Gun: used a .357 magnum and a .22 to intimidate and subdue vics. Only used gun on Kevin Bright when he broke free of his restraints (wasn`t killed). (2)                     
                    
Org: Has a `hit kit` and `hit clothes`. Would often mark his victims (which he referred to as projects or hits) and sometimes stalk them. Only Vain was randomly selected. Would lie to his victims to keep them calm. Would clean up after each murder. (2)                    
               
Totem type: took pictures of some of the vics. (2)          
     
Vic Pref: Rader admitted the males were just `bystanders` and were not the focus of the attacks. He seemed mostly focused on the young daughters of the family and expressed a desire to replicate what he did with Josephine. Rader also admitted to pedophile tendencies and said `Yeah, a pedophile. Yeah. But I never-you know, the only thing I ever got closest to is Josephine, and I never had any sex with any kids or anything like that. But if the opportunity would arise as I got older...` (2)         
                      
Note: Bill Thomas Killman (Rader`s Alias) was also used to mirror the acronym BTK. (1) Rader would `often send notes to the police signing himself as `BTK`, which stood for Bind, Torture, Kill`(Robinson, 2005; Bartels & Parsons, 2009, p.269). (1) `This acronym [BTK] mirrors his primary method of killing he used[...]` (Bartels & Parsons, 2009, p.269). (1)      
      
For the murders Rader planned out, he would give them code names. Fox was `Project Foxhunt`, Bright was `Project Lights Out`, etc. (2)","BTK, The BTK Strangler",0,1,0,0,0,,,,,,
