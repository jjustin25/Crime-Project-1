The revised figures include 5 inmates who were either reported late to the National Prisoner Statistics program or were not in custody of State correctional authorities on December 31, 2015 (1 each in Ohio, Mississippi, Oklahoma, California and Nevada), and exclude 14 inmates who were relieved of a death sentence before December 31, 2015 (3 each in Georgia and Texas; 2 in California; and 1 each in Missouri, MIssissippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Nevada).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
